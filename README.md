# JetsProject
For all the troops at our airbases overseas, it would be comforting for leadership to be able to quickly determine assets and capabilities. Behold, the spark for such a useful and timely system. No one wants to be operating in eastern Ukraine or the Middle east and be concerned that it will take several hours to ascertain the capabilities of aircraft on deck.

This clever application allows the user to:
Track inventory
Receive status on takeoff and flight duration
Add to the inventory
Remove from the inventory
Utilize scanning capabilities
Utilize armaments

This application has many future growth opportunities.

# Challenges from this Coding Exercise
This week presented many challenges. I really struggled with getting objects in and out of the ArrayList and having so many classes and additional interfaces, I agonized over where to build ot certain aspects of the application.

The positive side of this is I know this challenge has made me better. I do feel like I learned a lot, not only since starting the program but this week specifically. I do feel like I did spin my wheels on simple things that merely take repetition, like simply typing out the proper code in the proper way with parenthesis and brackets and diamond brackets in correct places.

As a student those struggles add up and make me feel incapable, though I know that is a fleeting feeling that comes with riding down the rollercoaster.

# Code Specific Notes
This code has room to grow. I added additional items to my interfaces thinking I would be able to get creative and incorporate them and do stretch goals. I just simply did not have the time to implement those items.

# Technology used
I built this application and associated classes and interfaces in Eclipse. I used Atom to write out my README, and for reference materials I used google but also received great instruction from John during TA hours on Saturday.
